			<h1> Seven Letters </h1>
			<h3> by Lesli Tabile </h2>
			<h3> How many months have gone by?</h3>
			<h3> Many times have I tried to hide.</h3>
			<h3> Whenever the two pass each other by,</h3>
			<h3> They avoid each other's stare and presence.</h3>
	
			<h3> Sometimes, I sit here and wonder</h3>
			<h3> If even for an instance</h3>
			<h3> I ever crossed your mind</h3>
		
			<h3> Out of guilt and contemplation</h3>
			<h3> Unsaid thoughts remain unsaid</h3>
			<h3> And if the other finally gathers the courage</h3>
			<h3> To confront, to apologize, to forgive.</h3>
		
			<h3> Only will the other be reminded</h3>
			<h3> Of their "friendship"</h3>
			<h3> Remaining as distant friends</h3>
			<h3> Slowly turned into what they were before they met.</h3>
		
			<h3> I wanted to say that "I'm sorry"</h3>
			<h3> Been waiting for so long</h3>
			<h3> To say these simple, short seven letters</h3>
			<h3> Hoping that it isn't too late...</h3>
